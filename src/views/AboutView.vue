    <p>
      <strong>MinoMuncher</strong> is a tool that analyzes TTRM files to extrapolate more advanced stats than would
      normally be possible.
      Instead of looking at the few raw stats that a shallow analysis can provide, the bot simulates each game action by
      action,
      logging information about line clears, boards, and gamestates along the way.
